Load-Clixml.ps1 contains a function "Load-Clixml" which simply imports all xml files in a specified folder and creates corresponding variables in the global scope. For example, for a file "ExchangeServer.xml" it creates a variable $ExchangeServer.  This script is just to make it easy to load all the xml files collected.  You do not need this file to use Collect-ExchangeInfo.ps1 and this function can be used independently.

# Sample usage
1. This will collect only Active Directory-based information  

    ```PowerShell
    .\Collect-ExchangeInfo.ps1 -Path C:\exinfo
    ```

2. In addition to the information gathered by 1., this will include machine-specific informtion for servers whose name matches ("EX-*").  Their event logs + Exchange's crimson logs are also collected.

    ```PowerShell
    .\Collect-ExchangeInfo.ps1 -Path C:\exinfo -Servers:EX-* -IncludeEventLogsWithCrimson
    ```
